 Silent extension providing connection to Discord RPC, so it would show a fancy table in the user profile. Extension is silent, so no additional tabs will clutter your visual space.

 ## References
 
 The plugin uses this python connector to RPC https://github.com/LyQuid12/Discord-RPC.

### The code allowing dynamic updates have some threading problems, so is disabled for now. If you liked this extension or its idea, I'd appreciate any help in its development.

## Known issues and troubleshooting

In case it will give a package error after the installation, restart the webui.

To uninstall the extension, in case it freezes the program, close the webui, go to the 'extensions' folder and remove the plugin.
